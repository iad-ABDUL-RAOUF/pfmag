# WORK IN PROGRESS.

It compiles but I did not tried to execute it yet. Some features are also missing. In order to test it I first need to create a dataset.

Stay tuned for future updates.

Also I will provide the list of important files to look at for each part of the project.

The simultaneous localisation and calibration part may be more difficult (but more interesting ?) than the resampling part. Choose your subject carefully...

# Compilation

I already created a Makefile for you. Open a terminal, go in the directory and type :
```shell
make
```
You will need to update the Makefile everytime you add a new ".c" file.

To remove all the generated files :
```shell
make clean
```

And if you only want to remove all ".o" files while keeping the executable :
```shell
make clean_object
```

# TODO

indiquer : comment executer (parametres...)
