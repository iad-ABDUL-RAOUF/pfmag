# WORK IN PROGRESS.

It compiles but I did not tried to execute it yet. Some features are also missing. In order to test it, I first need to create a dataset. You will aslo need it.

DO NOT TRY TO EXECUTE yet.

Stay tuned for future updates.

Also I will provide the list of important files to look at for each part of the project. The main is in pfmag.c

The simultaneous localisation and calibration part may be more difficult (but more interesting ?) than the resampling part. Choose your subject carefully...

# Dependencies

This code depend on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) for random number generation

```shell
sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev
```

# Compilation

I already created a Makefile for you, which should be updated everytime you add a new ".c" file.
Open a terminal, go in the directory and type :
```shell
make
```

To remove all the files generated by the compilation :
```shell
make clean
```

And if you only want to remove all ".o" files while keeping the executable :
```shell
make clean_object
```

# TODO

indiquer : comment executer (parametres...)
